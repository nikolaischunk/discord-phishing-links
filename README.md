## Removing a domain

If your domain was listed as being involved in Phishing due to your site being hacked or some other reason, please create a False Positive Issue. It unfortunately happens to many website owners.

### The domain in this repo no longer exists

We don't plan on removing links even if they no longer resolve to a valid IP/webpage, as they are and were still created for phishing. However, if by chance any of these domains are acquired by Discord themselves for legitimate purpose, feel free to create an Issue on that & we will update it accordingly!
