# ⚠️ Discord Phishing Links

A JSON list of malicious links with ![domains](https://img.shields.io/badge/dynamic/json?color=inactive&label=&query=count&url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.schunk.dev%2Fapi%2Fdomain%2Fcount&cacheSeconds=3600) unique domains which are used for [phishing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing) on [Discord](https://discord.com).

## NPM Package

The JSON is the source of the NPM Package [stop-discord-phishing](https://www.npmjs.com/package/stop-discord-phishing). Feel free to check it out!

## Removing a Domain

If your domain was listed as being involved in phishing due to your site being hacked or some other reason, please create a False Positive Issue. It unfortunately happens to many website owners.

### The domain in this repo no longer exists

We don't plan on removing links even if they no longer resolve to a valid IP/webpage, as they **are** and **were** still created for phishing. However, if by chance any of these domains are acquired by Discord themselves for legitimate purpose, feel free to create an Issue on that & we will update it accordingly!

## Known missing domains

| Domain   | Reason                              |
| -------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `ord.gg` | Cause for some false positive flags |
